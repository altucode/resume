  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      I'm a high-school graduate and avid programming enthusiast. Primarily self-taught, but my experience with web development and Ruby/Rails/HTML/CSS comes from the good folks at <a href="www.appacademy.io">AppAcademy</a> (which I'd highly recommend for anyone looking to get into the field but not sure where to start). I've been coding since 2010 and expanding my repetoire of languages ever since.
